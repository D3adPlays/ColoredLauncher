# - How to compile/execute [ColoredLauncher](https://github.com/D3adPlays/ColoredLauncher/)? ðŸ’»

As previousely metioned, this is my first Typescrypt/electon app, do the compile/execute process is verry basic;

  1. Run ```npm install``` to install all the required dependencies.

  2. Run ```npm run dev``` to launch the application with [electron-reload](https://github.com/yan-foto/electron-reload) enabled **OR** run ```npm run start``` to launch the application without [electron-reload](https://github.com/yan-foto/electron-reload) enabled.
  
***///TODO***

  ~3. Run ```npm run dist``` to pack the application as a single .exe installer.~
